As seen in the screenshot above, when using linear regression to analyize which variables provide the non-random amount of variance to mpg, vehicle length and ground clearance, respectively, have the most impact.
Furthermore, with a p-value of 5.35e-11, far less than the significance level of 0.05, we can conclude that the slope will not be zero
In conclusion, by using this linear model and achieving multiple R-squared value of 0.7149, we can declare that the variables given today have a good chance of prediciting miles per gallon
